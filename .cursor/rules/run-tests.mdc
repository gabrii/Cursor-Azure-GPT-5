# Running tests

After finishing any big code changes, and before yielding to the user, run with your terminal tool the following comand:

```
source .venv/bin/activate && pytest -k ""
```

You don't need to preface it with /bin/bash -c, nor add | cat at the end. Just run it as is.

If you want to run linting and tests, perform 2 parallel function calls
