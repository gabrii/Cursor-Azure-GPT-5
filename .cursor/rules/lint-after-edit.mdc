# Lint and Format After Edits

After finishing any big code changes, and before yielding to the user, run with your terminal tool the following comand:

```
source .venv/bin/activate && flask lint
```

This command will:
- Run **black** to automatically format the codebase.
- Run **flake8** to flag any remaining formatting or lint issues.

You don't need to preface it with /bin/bash -c, nor add | cat at the end. Just run it as is.

This ensures the codebase remains clean, consistent, and compliant with style guidelines after every edit.
